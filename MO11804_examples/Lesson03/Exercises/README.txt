The Users_Groups_Workflow.cex file can be used to import all users and groups.


IMPORTANT_IMPORTANT_IMPORTANT - CAUTION: 
You must first delete the default workflow PRIOR to performing the import of Users_Groups_Workflow.cex.

The workflow is included so that state and transition permissions could be properly exported.
After importing you MUST set the Permissions per Folder for each group as these are not exportable.

Also, you MAY need to re-set user passwords.
